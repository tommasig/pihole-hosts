# pihole-hosts
List of hosts to block on pihole.

Given the problem of the TP-Link TL-WA855RE V1, as discussed at this link (https://community.tp-link.com/us/home/forum/topic/100423),
I decided to block the list of domains that the repeater keeps interrogating.

For versions V2+ TP-Link released updated firmwares to fix the problem.
